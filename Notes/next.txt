  - An option to hide an assignment from the public gradebook would be great!
  - Does not exist error pages when trying to access a nonexistent student or assignment. (Use 404s!)
  - Use Student.full_name. I think there's a bug too (using it in a template didn't work)

  - Add workflow to edit grades from a student's page.
  - Maybe change points -> grade in the grade table. 
  - Message flashing for things like user creation. (Message in base.html, probably)
  - DRY up the forms.
  - DRY up the CRUD
  - Form pre-filling on fail of creation
  - Form validation on creation
  - HTML labels on forms
  - CSSed forms http://www.cssdrive.com/index.php/examples/exampleitem/tableless_forms/
  - Investigate need to secure POST forms. Don't want people CSRFing a delete or something. Use a nonce?
