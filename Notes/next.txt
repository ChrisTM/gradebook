  - Does not exist error pages when trying to access a nonexistent student or assignment. (Use 404s!)
  - Use Student.full_name. I think there's a bug too (using it in a template didn't work)
  - Error page on publcic gradebook when assignment is newly created.
  - Style & markup to right-justify gradebook numbers

  - Here is a query to get average grades:
		SELECT student.pk, student.first_name, ROUND(AVG(grade.points),1) as avg_grade FROM student JOIN grade ON student.pk = grade.student_pk GROUP BY student.pk;

  - Add workflow to edit grades from a student's page.
  - Maybe change points -> grade in the grade table. 
  - Message flashing for things like user creation. (Message in base.html, probably)
  - DRY up the forms.
  - DRY up the CRUD
  - Form pre-filling on fail of creation
  - Form validation on creation
  - HTML labels on forms
  - CSSed forms http://www.cssdrive.com/index.php/examples/exampleitem/tableless_forms/
  - Investigate need to secure POST forms. Don't want people CSRFing a delete or something. Use a nonce?
