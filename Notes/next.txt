  - Zero valued grades don't render in the templates! This is because it's actually zero, and not a string. Zero evaluates to false. So empty string gets printed.
  - Maybe change points -> grade in the grade table. 
  - The ordering of student names is not consistent across pages.
  - Message flashing for things like user creation. (Message in base.html, probably)
  - DRY up the forms.
  - Encapsulate the SQL into a active-record-like thing.
  - DRY up the CRUD
  - Form pre-filling on fail of creation
  - Form validation on creation
  - HTML labels on forms
  - CSSed forms http://www.cssdrive.com/index.php/examples/exampleitem/tableless_forms/
  - Investigate need to secure POST forms. Don't want people CSRFing a delete or something. Use a nonce?
  - Investigate SQL cascades for when deleting assignments (grades get deleted) or students (grades get deleted).
