  - Write the bits to add grades.
  - Be consistent with use of pk, id. Choose one and stick to it.
  - Maybe change points -> grade in the grade table. 
  - Maybe make view separate from update?
  - Message flashing for things like user creation. (Message in base.html, probably)
  - DRY up the forms.
  - Encapsulate the SQL into a active-record-like thing.
  - DRY up the CRUD
  - Form pre-filling on fail of creation
  - Form validation on creation
  - Proper labels on forms
  - Investigate need to secure POST forms. Don't want people CSRFing a delete or something. Use a nonce?
  - Investigate SQL cascades for when deleting assignments (grades get deleted) or students (grades get deleted).
